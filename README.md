# Language-Interpreter
Successful execution of a comprehensive language interpreter project, spanning 4 months and divided into five distinct phases, each demanding a unique set of skills.
## Phases
*	Phase 1 - Implemented a lexer using Finite State Automata for Datalog language token extraction.
*	Phase 2 - Developed a parser for constructing accurate data structures from Datalog programs.
*	Phase 3 - Created an interpreter using relational database operations for query evaluation based on schemes and facts.
*	Phase 4 - Expanded functionality with rule evaluation.
*		Phase 5 - Concluded with optimizing rule evaluation using a dependency graph and depth-first search. Demonstrated comprehensive skills in software design, database operations, and optimization strategies throughout the project.
